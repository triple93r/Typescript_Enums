    <h2>Enums in TypeScript are a way to define a set of named constants. They can be used to represent a group of related values, such as the days of the week or the months of the year.
To define an enum, you use the enum keyword, followed by the name of the enum and a list of its members. Each member is a named constant, and can be assigned a value.</h2>
